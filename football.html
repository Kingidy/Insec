            <p>
            Playmaking and Creativity: Messi is often hailed for his exceptional dribbling skills, his ability to glide past
            defenders, and his unparalleled vision and passing range. He can dictate the tempo of a game, create scoring
            opportunities for his teammates with intricate passes and through balls, and unlock defenses with his individual
            brilliance. His assist numbers significantly surpass Ronaldo's, highlighting his role as a playmaker.
            Goal-Scoring Efficiency: While Ronaldo boasts more career goals overall, Messi has a better goals-per-game ratio and
            minutes-per-goal ratio. This suggests that Messi is more efficient in converting his opportunities. He also has a higher
            shot conversion rate and a better percentage of shots on target.
            Individual Awards: Messi has won the prestigious Ballon d'Or award a record eight times, compared to Ronaldo's five. He
            also has more European Golden Shoe awards (six to Ronaldo's four), highlighting his superior goal-scoring prowess in
            European leagues over his career.
            Overall Impact: Many argue that Messi's influence on his team's performance goes beyond just goals and assists. His
            ability to control the game, create space, and link up with teammates makes him a more complete and impactful player in
            various phases of the game. His dribbling statistics and key passes completed are significantly higher than Ronaldo's.
            World Cup and Copa America: While both have achieved international success, Messi finally clinched the elusive FIFA
            World Cup title in 2022 and has also won two Copa América titles (2021 and 2024) with Argentina. These major
            international trophies are often considered crucial in the "greatest of all time" debate.
